# Lung-Capacity-Analysis
A data mining project in R done as a part of University course on Data Warehouse and Data Mining (BIT 309)

### Aim 
To analyse Lung Capacity data based on parameters such as Gender, Age, Height, birth type and Smokers/Non-smokers. 

### Modules 
1. To predict whether a person is a smoker or non-smoker based on their Lung Capacity, Age, Height and Gender.
    * KNN
    * K-means
    * Decision Tree
2. Decision Tree Classification to classify data entries as Large Volume or Small Volume.
3. Logistic Regression Analysis
    * to plot fitting probabilities and actual probabilities and analyse Gender vs Lung Capacity.
    * to predict Height(Short/ Tall) based on other independent parameters. 
    * to plot fitting probabilities and actual probabilities and analyse Height vs Lung Capacity.
